      Stage 1

The first segment of code sets up the required packages, data and objects for later in the project. 
It loads the packages "data.table" and "Reshape2", sets path as the current working directory and finally,
downloads and expand the zip file containing the data.


    Stage 2

The second section creates the object "measurements" which will be used later in the project to extract 
the mean and std from the two seperate datasets.

    Stage 3 / 4
    
Next, relatively the same code is repeated for both data sources, reading each file into the R project 
and combining them into two respective datasets; test and train.

   Stage 5

Test and train rows are combined into one dataset named "Merged"

  Stage 6

Data and variable are then rearanged to be more clear to the reader.

  Stage 7
  
 New data table is then written into a final text file.
